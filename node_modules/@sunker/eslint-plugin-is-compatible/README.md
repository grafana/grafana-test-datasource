# eslint-plugin-is-compatible

is-compatible is a simple eslint plugin that checks whether imports from any of the Grafana packages (`@grafana/ui`, `@grafana/data` and `@grafana/runtime`) from within a Grafana plugin source code exist in all the Grafana runtimes that the plugin is supposed to support.

## Why this repo?

I was expecting to find a link to a repo with the full code explained in Adam's article but I could not find it.

It will be a quick way to browse the full code on its own and possibly to enhance it by fixing issues.

## Getting started

I worked on this repo using `npm` but it should work with other package manager.

### Install

`npm i`

### Build

`npm build`

### Test

`npm test`

### Docs

`npm docs:init` will create new files for each rule if necessary.

`npm docs:update` will update existing files and the rules list.

You can see an example of generated documentation in the next section.
